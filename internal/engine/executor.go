//     no test binary exists yet to enforce it, so the context stays as the
//     backstop. It is also rooted in the engine's runCtx, so an external
//     cancellation (e.g. SIGTERM from a CI runner) propagates into the child and
//     we can tell "the runner is shutting us down" from "this mutant ran long".
//
// Classification cannot go on the exit status alone. `go test` reports a test
// timeout, a build failure and an ordinary test failure all as exit status 1 —
// only the test BINARY exits 2, and what we spawn is `go`. Taking that 1 at face
