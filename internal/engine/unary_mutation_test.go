// means something different by each. Mutating a prefix `&` as if it were
// bitwise AND turns `&Foo{}` into `|Foo{}`, which does not parse; mutating a
// prefix `^` the same way turns `^u` into `&u`, which no longer has the
// operand's type. Neither is a fault a test suite could have caught, so
// neither is generated.
